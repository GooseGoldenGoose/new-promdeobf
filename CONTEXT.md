# Prometheus Lua/Luau Deobfuscator - Live Handoff

## Project

Workspace:
`C:\Users\reala\Desktop\!workspaces\promdeobf ova\new promdeobf`

Repository:
`https://github.com/GooseGoldenGoose/new-promdeobf.git`

Authoritative branch: `main`.

Current best verified solver checkpoint:
`2a55d22 Optimize beta control-flow hot paths`

`main` and `origin/main` are aligned at that commit. Prior beta checkpoint:
`485130e Checkpoint beta solver working tree`.

Treat this file as the authoritative handoff. If Git is newer, Git wins.

## Mandatory Workflow

- Read this file first in a new chat.
- Run `git status --short --branch` and `git log --oneline --decorate -8` before changing anything.
- Do not ask the user to repeat decisions already recorded here.
- Use the connected native Windows shell for project work.
- Every tracked project code/content change gets a focused commit and `git push origin main`.
- Stage only files belonging to the current change.
- Never clean/reset/overwrite/stage unrelated working-copy files.
- Keep `CONTEXT.md` current, but replace stale history instead of endlessly appending.
- Reparse generated Lua after transformations.
- Run focused regressions and runtime parity where executable.
- Fail closed when structural proof is incomplete.
- End every project-related turn with exactly: `Done for this turn — you can prompt now.`

### Preserve unrelated working-copy files

Latest known user/unrelated tracked edits:

```text
sample/20.source.lua
sample/23.source.lua
sample/23.txt
```

Common intentionally untracked items:

```text
formater/
output/
sample/*.source.obfuscated.lua
sample/sixzens.txt
sample/spacial*.txt
```

Do not stage these automatically.

## Core Rules

Everything must be structural, generalized, and dynamic.

Never hardcode sample IDs, filenames, VM state IDs, register names, random constants/strings, closure suffixes/arities, offsets, methods, URLs, or fixture-specific values.

Fix the earliest responsible AST/CFG/data-flow/scope/upvalue cause. Never patch final emitted text to hide bad analysis.

Preserve evaluation order, call count, side effects, multi-return behavior, lexical ownership, globals vs locals, closure identity, mutable upvalues, table/object identity, zero-iteration loop behavior, break/continue/return, and namecall `:` semantics.

A physical VM register is not one source binding. Dispatcher nesting is not lexical scope. The VM `state`/POS register can also hold ordinary compiler temporaries.

Globals such as `game`, `pairs`, `ipairs`, `table.insert`, etc. remain globals unless lexical provenance proves otherwise.

## Prometheus Authority

When the user says Prometheus, use the local WeAreDevs compiler:

`C:\Users\reala\Desktop\!workspaces\promdeobf ova\wearedev obf`

Compiler source:
`src\prometheus\compiler\compiler.lua`

Do not substitute public/canonical Prometheus unless explicitly asked.

Current observed local Medium preset:

- LuaU
- EncryptStrings enabled
- Vmify
- ConstantArray
- NumbersToExpressions
- WrapInFunction
- AntiTamper absent/disabled in the current Medium pipeline

Do not edit the external compiler preset unless explicitly asked.

## Fixture / Run Pipeline

Typical controlled path:

```text
sample/N.source.lua
-> local WeAreDevs Medium
-> formater\luau-format.exe
-> sample/N.txt
-> node main.js sample/N.txt output/N.lua
-> beta register/version analysis
-> beta control-flow recovery
```

Useful commands:

```text
node main.js sample\63.txt output\63.lua
node tools\beta-register-versions.js output\63.lua output\63.beta.lua
node tools\beta-control-flow.js output\63.lua output\63.beta.cf.lua
```

`deobf.bat <sample> normal|beta|cf` may also be used when present.

Standalone `output/*.beta.lua` is solver/intermediate representation and does not need to execute. Correctness matters for normal semantics and especially final beta-CF source.

## Current Architecture

Main pipeline:

```text
Luau parse
-> ConstantArray recovery
-> environment provenance / _env
-> closure factories
-> VM/helper semantic naming
-> safe parallel-assignment splitting
-> VM state / CFG recovery
-> binding/capture/provenance analysis
-> VM register scheduling
-> register presentation naming
-> final parse/output
```

Beta final-recovery path:

```text
normal output
-> beta register versions
-> beta lifetimes / ownership
-> beta upvalue recovery
-> beta control-flow structuring
-> closure-region inlining
-> final recovered source
```

### Structural helper recovery

Current recovery includes `_env`, `unpack`, `newproxy`, `setmetatable`, `getmetatable`, `select`, `vm`, `createUpvalueProxy`, `releaseUpvalues`, `releaseUpvalue`, `allocUpvalue`, `upvalueRefCounts`, `upvalueValues`, `currentUpvalueId`, `createClosure`, and fixed-arity `createClosureN`.

VM parameters are recovered structurally as:
`state, args, upvalues, gcProxy`.

### State/register invariants

- normalized state IDs are presentation only
- reaching definitions, provenance, epochs, lifetimes, ownership anchors, and capture cells drive recovery
- one physical register may hold multiple source lifetimes
- transitive value provenance alone must not merge unrelated ordinary register lifetimes
- captured-cell identity is stronger evidence because it is shared mutable storage
- terminal ReturnVal lowering is restricted to compiler-proven terminal shapes
- POS/state cleanup removes only proven dead compiler save/restore scaffolding

## Beta Control-Flow Capabilities

Current beta-CF supports proven:

- if / elseif / else
- shared joins
- guard/early returns
- multiple closure regions
- captured mutable upvalues
- numeric for
- generic for ... in
- while
- repeat ... until
- break
- continue
- early return inside loops
- nested/sequential loop mixtures
- multi-state short-circuit conditions
- captured loop variables
- visible numeric-for variable mutation with independent hidden induction state
- split Prometheus branch encodings
- dependency-safe reordered duplicate repeat-condition operations
- terminal return payload lowering
- per-function RegisterOverflow presentation

Generic-for currently proves the local compiler's two-variable shape including `pairs`, `next, table`, custom iterator triples, branches, break/continue, and captured variables. Unproven arities/shapes fail closed.

Repeat recovery is intended to remove the local compiler's discarded first repeat-condition evaluation and restore readable-source semantics.

## RegisterOverflow

Final CF normalizes proven static slots per recovered function:

`RegisterOverflow[n] -> RegisterOverflow.vN`

Each function gets its own `local RegisterOverflow = {}` only when it directly uses overflow storage. Dynamic/bare/invalid accesses fail closed.

Samples 5 and 10 are overflow stress fixtures. Their final CF can exceed LuaJIT's 200-local main-function limit; that is not a beta-CF generation failure.

## Verification State

All numeric fixtures currently present, sample 1 through 63, were tested.

Verified:

```text
normal generation: 63/63
beta generation: 63/63
beta-CF generation: 63/63
focused regression suites: 12/12 pass
```

Final-CF scaffold scan found no surviving dispatcher/state loop, `createClosure*`, `upvalueValues[...]`, `allocUpvalue(...)`, or `ReturnVal =` scaffolding in the checked numeric outputs.

During the performance optimization, every regenerated `output/N.beta.cf.lua` for 1-63 was byte-for-byte identical to its pre-optimization result.

Runtime classification:

- 21/22 differences are table pointer addresses only
- 29/30 prove intended repeat-source restoration; beta-CF matches readable source
- native Luau continue cannot be directly executed by LuaJIT
- Roblox/executor fixtures 61-63 require their real environment
- some CF re-obfuscation still hits the local compiler's known `Unresolved Upvalue` bug
- anti-tamper/formatter-sensitive fixtures are not always valid standalone LuaJIT parity tests

## Confirmed Correctness Issue: Sample 36

This is the known real beta-CF semantic regression.

Readable source begins repeat body with:

```text
short-repeat-body    0
```

Current beta-CF begins with:

```text
short-repeat-body    1
```

The solver retains the compiler-discarded pre-repeat short-circuit evaluation instead of fully restoring source repeat semantics.

Historical bisect:

```text
0237d60  GOOD
7a881ab  BAD
```

Regression introduced at:
`7a881ab Recover ReturnVal joins and CF tails`.

It remains in current main. Do not claim full 1-63 source-semantic parity until fixed structurally.

Sample 20 is separate: its working-copy source has user-added `o/l/d/f` prints while tracked `20.txt` was not regenerated. Do not treat that as a solver regression.

## Large / Special Probes

### Generic-for 53-59

Proves `pairs`, `next, table`, custom iterator factory, nested branches, break, continue, and captured generic-for variables. Captured loop variables use compiler cell allocation/alias/release evidence; do not generalize beyond proven shapes.

### Sample 60

Broad control-flow smoke fixture covering mixed loops, closures, captures, methods/namecall, branches, break/continue, and generic/numeric loops. Beta-CF structures successfully. Runtime validation is constrained by native Luau/compiler re-obfuscation limitations.

### Samples 61-63

Large Roblox/UI/executor scale fixtures. Normal/beta/beta-CF generate successfully. Use for structural regression/scale testing, not standalone LuaJIT parity claims.

### sixzens.txt

Untracked large probe. Latest observed beta-CF succeeded and proved split branch encoding, dependency-ready duplicate repeat-condition matching, terminal payload sinking/lowering, and large captured-cell recovery.

Known separate presentation issue: latest sixzens final CF still had two live `local ... = state` POS-data reads. A broad materialization attempt was unsafe and reverted. Only proven dead POS save/restore scaffolding should be auto-removed.

## Performance

Commit:
`2a55d22 Optimize beta control-flow hot paths`

Main improvements:

- early-terminating AST walkers for queries whose answer is already proven
- one-pass captured storage-use indexing in beta-upvalues instead of rescanning every operation for every captured cell/alias
- fail-closed proof logic unchanged

Sample 63 benchmark on the same working tree:

```text
before: 2605.8 ms average
after:   945.1 ms average
```

About 63.7% faster.

Safety validation:

- 12/12 focused suites pass
- 1-63 beta-CF regeneration passes
- 63/63 final CF outputs byte-for-byte identical to pre-optimization output

## Immediate Priorities

1. Fix sample 36 repeat-source regression structurally without regressing 29/30 or large encrypted repeat fixtures.
2. Keep large-file beta-CF near current optimized performance; profile before adding expensive global scans.
3. Preserve fail-closed behavior for unproven generic-for, POS/state-data, overflow, capture, and lifetime shapes.
4. Re-test numeric fixtures after meaningful CFG/upvalue/lifetime changes.
5. Keep this file compact; replace stale sections instead of appending chronology.

## New-Chat Resume

Read this file, inspect Git status/log, preserve unrelated working-copy files, continue the requested implementation directly, test it, update this file if needed, commit only intended files, and push main.

Do not merely summarize this handoff unless the user asks for a summary.
